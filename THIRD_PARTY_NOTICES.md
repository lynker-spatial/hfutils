# Third-party notices

`hfutils` is licensed under **Apache-2.0** (© Lynker Spatial). That
license applies to Lynker Spatial’s own code in this repository.

This package **depends on** third-party R packages that carry their own
licenses. Those packages are **not redistributed** with this source;
they are installed separately from CRAN (or their upstream source) by
the end user, so their licenses govern the user’s use of those packages,
independent of the Apache-2.0 grant here. Several are copyleft
(GPL/LGPL); using `hfutils` requires installing them and complying with
their terms.

This notice is provided for transparency and to answer reuse questions;
it adds no constraint to the Apache-2.0 grant on Lynker Spatial’s code.

## Direct dependencies

| License family | Packages |
|----|----|
| **GPL-2 / GPL-3 (≥)** | `igraph` (GPL ≥2), `terra` (GPL ≥3), `lwgeom` (GPL-2), `units` (GPL-2) |
| **GPL-2 \| MIT (dual)** | `sf`, may be used under MIT |
| **LGPL (≥2.1)** | `DBI`, `RSQLite` |
| **MIT** | `cli`, `dbplyr`, `dplyr`, `duckdb`, `glue`, `httr2`, `jsonlite`, `rlang`, `rmapshaper`, `yyjsonr` |

| **Part of R (base)** | `methods`, `utils` |

## Notes for redistributors

- The copyleft licenses above (GPL/LGPL) impose obligations on
  **distribution of those packages**. Distributing `hfutils`’s own
  source does not redistribute them. If you bundle these dependencies
  into a combined distribution (e.g. a container image or a vendored
  archive), comply with each package’s license for that distribution.
- `sf` offers a permissive option (MIT).
- This list reflects direct dependencies. Transitive dependencies carry
  their own licenses; standard CRAN tooling resolves them at install
  time.
